# Configuration‚öôÔ∏è[^1]

`ranger` use 4 main configuration files:

* `rc.conf` is used for setting various options and binding keys to functions.
* `rifle.conf` decides which program to use for opening a file.
* `scope.sh` is a shell script used to generate previews for various file types.
* `commands.py` contains various functions' implementation, written in Python, used to modify `ranger's` behavior, and implement you own Custom Commands.

Use `ranger --copy-config=rc` or one of `rifle, scope, commands` to copy the default config files to `~/.config/ranger` and modify them there, only copy the files you want to edit. Be aware that for `rc.conf` and `commands.py`, ranger reads *both* the global *and* the user's config (in that order). It allows the user to maintain only a small config which sets only the things not set in the default one. For `scope.sh` and `rifle.conf`, ranger read *either* the user's *or* the global config.

However, in 2022 Oct, Windows Terminal still doesn't support curse libs...[^2]ü§î.
No way...
