# GNU Stow Install/Uninstall Implementation - Step 4 Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented install/uninstall actions with conflict detection using GNU Stow in the `stow-posix.sh` script.

## Features Implemented

### 1. GNU Stow Availability Check
- ✅ Checks if `stow` command is available using `command -v stow`
- ✅ Provides explicit error message with installation instructions for different platforms:
  - macOS: `brew install stow`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install stow`
  - CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install stow`
  - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S stow`
- ✅ Aborts with exit code 1 if GNU Stow is not present

### 2. Install Function with Conflict Detection
- ✅ Iterates through selected packages
- ✅ Runs `stow --no-folding -t "$TARGET" PACKAGE` for each package
- ✅ Captures stderr output to detect conflicts
- ✅ Detects conflicts when stow exits with code 1 and output contains "would cause conflicts"
- ✅ Parses conflicting files from stderr output
- ✅ Provides helpful hints when conflicts are detected:
  1. Back up existing files and try again
  2. Use 'uninstall' to remove conflicting symlinks from other packages
  3. Manually resolve conflicts by removing/moving existing files
  4. Use 'stow --adopt' to adopt existing files into the package
- ✅ Returns appropriate exit codes (0=success, 1=general error, 2=conflict)

### 3. Uninstall Function with Existence Confirmation
- ✅ Calls `stow -D -t "$TARGET" PACKAGE` to remove symlinks
- ✅ Confirms package directory exists before attempting uninstall
- ✅ Warns with clear message if package doesn't exist
- ✅ Returns appropriate exit codes and provides feedback

### 4. Error Handling & User Experience
- ✅ Comprehensive error messages with emojis for better readability
- ✅ Verbose mode support with detailed logging
- ✅ Dry-run mode for preview without making changes
- ✅ Installation/uninstallation summaries with success/failure counts
- ✅ Proper directory navigation with error recovery

### 5. Package Support
- ✅ Individual package installation: `./stow-posix.sh install shell/shell-fish`
- ✅ Category installation: `./stow-posix.sh install shell`
- ✅ Multiple package support: `./stow-posix.sh install shell editor`
- ✅ All packages: `./stow-posix.sh install all`

## Testing Results

### GNU Stow Availability
```bash
# When stow is missing
ERROR: GNU Stow is not installed or not in PATH
Please install GNU Stow:
  - On macOS: brew install stow
  - On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install stow
  - On CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install stow
  - On Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S stow
```

### Conflict Detection
```bash
# When conflicts are detected
❌ Installation failed due to conflicts: test-package
   Conflicting files/directories:
  - WARNING! stowing test-package would cause conflicts:
  - * cannot stow config/test-category/test-package/.testfile over existing target .testfile since neither a link nor a directory and --adopt not specified

   💡 Suggested solutions:
   1. Back up existing files and try again
   2. Use 'uninstall' to remove conflicting symlinks from other packages
   3. Manually resolve conflicts by removing/moving existing files
   4. Use 'stow --adopt' to adopt existing files into the package
```

### Successful Operations
```bash
# Installation success
✅ Successfully installed: shell-fish

# Uninstallation success  
✅ Successfully uninstalled: shell-fish

# Summary reporting
📊 Installation summary:
   ✅ Successful: 1
   ❌ Failed: 0
```

### Package Not Found
```bash
# When uninstalling non-existent package
⚠️  Package 'non-existent' not found in category 'test-category'
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Install specific package
./stow-posix.sh install shell/shell-fish

# Install with verbose output
./stow-posix.sh -v install shell/shell-fish

# Dry run installation
./stow-posix.sh -n install shell/shell-fish

# Install entire category
./stow-posix.sh install shell

# Uninstall package
./stow-posix.sh uninstall shell/shell-fish

# Custom target directory
./stow-posix.sh -t /tmp install shell/shell-fish
```

## Technical Details

### Key Implementation Points
1. **Conflict Detection**: Uses exit code 1 + stderr pattern matching for "would cause conflicts"
2. **Error Recovery**: Removed `set -e` to allow proper error handling without script termination
3. **Directory Management**: Proper CD handling with error recovery to original directory
4. **Package Validation**: Checks for dotfiles (files/directories starting with '.') before attempting stow
5. **POSIX Compliance**: Uses standard shell constructs for maximum compatibility

### Exit Codes
- 0: Success
- 1: General error
- 2: Conflict detected (install only)
- 3: Package/category not found

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All requirements from Step 4 have been successfully implemented and tested.

The implementation leverages GNU Stow with proper conflict detection, provides helpful user feedback, and handles all edge cases appropriately.
